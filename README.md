# Phase 1: Week 4: Project
Project for SD Phase 1

# TYCHO ART GALLERY

- For this project, I will create a single page application for an art gallery where users can view and bookmark pieces.

- Tycho art gallery is open for business


# Project Setup

## Requirements

1. Text editor such as VsCode editor is required
2. We will use json-server to access data from an API server
3. Knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


## Installations
- For this project, I used an Art Institute of Chicago API with the url: https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks?fields=id,title,artist_display,date_display,main_reference_number,image_id.
- Before running the application, make sure that you have installed the json-server globally. If not, run this on your command line: npm install -g json-server. This will install json-server and help to get the backend started.
- To initiate the backend, run the following command while inside the project directory: json-server --watch db.json
- The server can be tested by visiting through the browser using the website: https://api.npoint.io/fb6348ea0f63624394bb/data/ , which is also the base URL for the API.


# Live Link to the Application 

The live link to the web application cab be found [here](https://phase-1-wk4-project.vercel.app/)


# Minimum Viable Product

These are the objectives for the web application:

1. As a user I should be able to see artworks and their details, including the artist's name and the date the piece was displayed, 
2. As a user, I should be able to scroll down a side-bar and view the artwork of my choice. 
3. As a user, I should be able to remove any artwork from my the page to remain with preferred pieces.
4. As a user, I should be able to add an artwork to my favorites.
